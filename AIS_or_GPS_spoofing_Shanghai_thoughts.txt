GPS anomalies in Shanghai Port.
What's about these GPS "hacking" or "spoofing" in Shanghai, or is it more likely that this mistery is only spoofing of the AIS signals?
Well, i was reading that article of Mark Harris, published in Technology review on November 15.2019 about "GPS mystery in Shanghai - https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614689/ghost-ships-crop-circles-and-soft-gold-a-gps-mystery-in-shanghai"
a couple of times and try to bring a little more light into the dark.
I say, some of the claimed issues could rely on GPS spoofing and has effects in AIS as described in the article.
But i think it is more an AIS Spoofing issue, but it's hard to figure out what realy happend. 
AIS spoofing is very easy, GPS spoofing is more complex but not unlikely.

Now let's try me to explain how this could work and who is able to do so.

First of all, the term GPS is public known for "Global positioning service", a Service of the USA and corectly named Navstar-GPS.
Most of us uses the Term GPS, but whe have to keep in mind that there are more of them. 
GNSS (global navigation satelite system) is the correct naming for Satelite Navigation and there are a couple of them:
	Navstar-GPS - USA - Global Positioning Service
	Galileo - European Union - (no exlanation)
	Beidou - Chinese - Astorid dipper constellation as name
	Glonass - Russia - Globalnaja nawigazionnaja sputnikowaja sistema
	and more.
	
Comming back to the story, I think in this one example it's more likely an GPS spoofing scenario that "someone" did in the Port of Shanghai rather than AIS spoofing.
After reading the GPS issue on https://navcen.uscg.gov/?Do=GPSReportStatus#definition i scrolled to the part where source event was happend.
There you find 3 incidents :
09/08/2019    2200 China Taiwan Time 	- User: After docking in Shanghai, China, the GPS receiver was displaying incorrect position, speed and an audible beeping alarm. We believe it was due to interference.
09/02/2019    0545 GMT 					- User: Vessel fast at container terminal working cargo. Speed and sometimes position jumping on all three units plus cell phone applications.
09/02/2019    0545 GMT 					- User: Vessel is at berth working cargo in Shanghai experienced GPS issue.
All of them seems to be an interference. No other reports by other ships.
But an interference could also be due to spoofed signals. And the AIS data is also altered by the spoofed GPS.

But lets

Now it becomes more technical to explain:
If you try to spoof the position of one ship, you have to spoof multiple GNSS receiver the same time, becaus the AIS transmitter is getting 
the current position from his own GNSS Antenna. Mostly, Vessels have more than one GNSS receiver. 
Lets take a (short) deeper look onto that.
Spoofing a GNSS signal and let a GNSS receiver think it has a new possition ist not an big deal. Ther are a couple of tools, Hardware and Software, 
out there starting at around 500 bucks that you have to invest on Hardware like an BladeRF device to send and receive Signals via Software defined Radio (SDR). 
On the Software side you need now the daily correct empheris file for the satelit constalation of the day. From this, u have to generate new positions that you
have then to send to your target, for example a ship. The big problem is to overide the signal of that one (or more) GNSS receivers on your Target.
You have to be more or less in "line of sight" to all of your GNSS Antennas on the Vessel. (maybe this could give a hint to the direction of the attack)?
The Target could be a Vessel any type, like cargo or a Yacht. So you need now to send a spoofed signal to your Target with your equipment. So far, no big deal.
But, depending on the receiver on board, you have to override the signal slowly by increasing signal strenght to let the GNSS receiver take your signal as new source.
For those who want to read more, here is a more detailed explanation of the mechanism how a Navstar-GPS receiver gets a lock. http://www.gpsinformation.net/main/gpslock.htm
When you are now successfully, the new position of the ship will appear on the display onboard and later on also send via AIS to other.
So it will look like on the ECDIS - the Electronic Chart Display - of other ships, that a you have a new position and speed. 

Now, lets explain a little bit more how AIS works: 
(remember, it will get its Position from GPS, all other information like heading, speed over ground etc. from internal NMEA network)

The AIS (Automatic Identification System)  is primarily intended, to allow ships to view marine traffic in their area and to be seen by that traffic.
Original purpose was Collision avoidance, but several other applications like fishing fleet monitoring, security and SAR using it also.
Technically it is using mostly an VHF transceiver to send and receive the Informations on maritime channel 87B (161.975 Mhz) and 88B (162.025 MHz).
The AIS is sending following Data: (only a selection)
	MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identity - (like your mobile phone IMSI an unique ID)
	Navigation Status like "at anchor", "moored" etc.
	speed over ground
	heading
	position
	type of ship
	IMO-ship identification number and radio call sign
	Name of the vessel
	dimension of the ship
	destination
and many other informations.

So all of these informations can also received by anyone in range of the signal, or you can them lookup on websites like marinetraffic.com or vesselfinder.com
All Information needed for spoofing an Vessel via AIS is already there, you have ony to generate the spoofed signals.
On the hardware side, only a Software defined Radio (SDR) that is able to send radio signals is needed. For that, devices like the HackRF aure there for less than 300$
The only other thing needed is now a Software to send the Signals. For that, the Gnue Radio companion (GRC) is needed and a flow chart about what you whant to do.
For the AIS , there are Flowcharts for receiving and for sending available on the Internet. 
So from the security side of view, the AIS has no security in place for accuracy of the sended Information. No authentication and autorisations and no encryption.
Everyone who is able to understand how AIS is working (no probling for interested humans) is able to send fake or ghost ships whereever they want.
And this is, what I think, happend at Shanghai Port. 
To proof that i am wrong or right, I (or someone else) have to analyse onsite the radiosignals and evaluate them during an attack.
As an good read onto AIS security i can recommend the report done by Trendmicro onto it, available here: https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/a-security-evaluation-of-ais

One thing in the Article is suspicious to me. The circling patterns of the C4ADS report and the detail, that they aggregated the logs of 2 years of
AIS movements and made their conclusion from it.
So it is not clear, was it AIS Spoofing or GPS spoofing. It could be both with mostly the same results. Combination of GPS Jamming and AIS spoofing seems a legit explanation. 

Ok, now whe have a way to let appear or move vessels on electronic charts. This could be done by spoof the GPS position of one or more ships or
by spoofing the AIS Position, which is much easier and is able to produce also ghost ships.
But why and what could happen?
Maybe a speculative application is to try to force a colliosion of vessesl in the harbour.
Some of the anti collision systems on vessels rely only on AIS informations and suggest an alternative course to avoid a collision based on the speed and course of the ships.
If they maybe run on autopilot or under reduced sight by heavy wheather conditions or fog......
But this is only an assumption of me.

My conclusion on this Shanghai case:
someone is for whatever reason spoofing the GNSS and AIS in the Port of Shanghai.
GPS spoofing is reported and also AIS spoofing was detected.
