What's about these GPS "hacking" or "spoofing" in Shanghai, or is it more likely that this mistery is only spoofing of the AIS signals?
Well, i was reading that article of Mark Harris, published in Technology review on November 15.2019 about "GPS mystery in Shanghai - https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614689/ghost-ships-crop-circles-and-soft-gold-a-gps-mystery-in-shanghai"
a couple of times and try to bring a little more light into the dark.
I say, its AIS spoofing and nothing more. 
Very short Explanation is due to the effort an "attacker" have to put into to archive this behavior.
AIS spoofing is very easy, GPS spoofing like in this case is very complex.

Now let's try me to explain how this could work and who is able to do so.

First of all, the term GPS is public known for "Global positioning service", a Service of the USA and corectly named Navstar-GPS.
Most of us uses the Term GPS, but whe have to keep in mind that there are more of them. 
GNSS (global navigation satelite system) is the correct naming for Satelite Navigation and there are a couple of them:
	Navstar-GPS - USA - Global Positioning Service
	Galileo - European Union - (no exlanation)
	Beidou - Chinese - Astorid dipper constellation as name
	Glonass - Russia - Globalnaja nawigazionnaja sputnikowaja sistema
	and more.
	
Comming back to the story, I think it's more an AIS spoofing scenario that "someone" did in the Port of Shanghai rather than GNSS spoofing.
Let me try to explain why:
If you try to spoof the position of one ship, you have to spoof multiple GNSS receiver the same time, becaus the AIS transmitter is getting 
the current position from his own GNSS Antenna. Mostly, Vessels have more than one GNSS receiver. 
Lets take a (short) deeper look onto that.
Spoofing a GNSS signal and let a GNSS receiver think it has a new possition ist not an big deal. Ther are a couple of tools, Hardware and Software, 
out there starting at around 500 bucks that you have to invest. The big problem is to overide the signal of that one (or more) GNSS receivers on your Target.
The Target could be a Vessel any type, like cargo or a Yacht. So you need now to send a spoofed signal to your Target with your equipment. So far, no big deal.
But, depending on the receiver on board, you have to override the signal slowly by increasing signal strenght to let the GNSS receiver take your signal as new source.
For those who want to read more, here is a more detailed explanation of the mechanism how a Navstar-GPS receiver gets a lock. http://www.gpsinformation.net/main/gpslock.htm

The AIS (Automatic Identification System)  is primarily intended, to allow ships to view marine traffic in their area and to be seen by that traffic.
Original purpose was Collision avoidance, but several other applications like fishing fleet monitoring, security and SAR using it also.
Technically it is using mostly an VHF transceiver to send and receive the Informations on maritime channel 87B (161.975 Mhz) and 88B (162.025 MHz).
The AIS is sending following Data: (only a selection)
	MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identity - (like your mobile phone IMSI an unique ID)
	Navigation Status like "at anchor", "moored" etc.
	speed over ground
	heading
	position
	type of ship
	IMO-ship identification number and radio call sign
	Name of the vessel
	dimension of the ship
	destination
and many other informations.
So all of these informations can also received by anyone in range of the signal, or you can them lookup on websites like marinetraffic.com or vesselfinder.com
All Information needed for spoofing an Vessel via AIS is already there, you have ony to generate the spoofed signals.
On the hardware side, only a Software defined Radio (SDR) that is able to send radio signals is needed. For that, devices like the HackRF aure there for less than 300$
The only other thing needed is now a Software to send the Signals. For that, the Gnue Radio companion (GRC) is needed and a flow chart about what you whant to do.
For the AIS , there are Flowcharts for receiving and for sending available on the Internet. 
So from the security side of view, the AIS has no security in place for accuracy of the sended Information. No authentication and autorisations and no encryption.
Everyone who is able to understand how AIS is working (no probling for interested humans) is able to send fake or ghost ships whereever they want.
And this is, what I think, happend at Shanghai Port. 
To proof that i am wrong or right, I (or someone else) have to analyse onsite the radiosignals and evaluate them during an attack.
As an good read onto AIS security i can recommend the report done by Trendmicro onto it, available here: https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/a-security-evaluation-of-ais

Ok, now whe have a way to let appear or move vessels on electronic charts, but why and what could happen?
Maybe a speculative application is to try to force a colliosion of vessesl in the harbour.
Some of the anti collision systems on vessels rely only on AIS informations and suggest an alternative course to avoid a collision based on the speed and course of the ships.
If they maybe run on autopilot or under reduced sight by heavy wheather conditions or fog......
But this is only an assumption of me.
 
My conclusion on this Shanghai case:
someone is for whatever reason spoofing the AIS information in the Port of Shanghai.
